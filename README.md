## PlayAlways - Create playgrounds quickly

PlayAlways is a menubar app to quickly create new iOS or macOS playgrounds.

[‚¨áÔ∏è LATEST RELEASE ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://github.com/insidegui/PlayAlways/releases/latest)

By default, the app creates the playgrounds on the location of the frontmost Finder window, if no Finder window is opened, the playground is created on the desktop.

If you want to choose where to save the playground, you can hold down option when choosing the playground type and a save panel will appear allowing you to choose the location.
